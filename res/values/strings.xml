    <string name="effective_temperature_blurb">First, we calculate the effective temperature. Effective temperature is the amount of heat available to heat a planet. Once mass (M), distance

(D) and bond albedo (A) are entered, effective temperature can be calculated using the general

equation����!" = ����!"#. ����!" is derived from the formula:

RateIN = !

!!!! ∗ ��! ∗ 1−� . 

 !

!!!! is “flux” in erg/cm2

fraction of starlight absorbed. RateOUT is calculated as (4πR2

the planet and (σT4

constant, equal to 5.6703 ∗ 10!!�����/��!/�!, and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin. By 

canceling out �! and solving for T we get the following formula for effective temperature:

    <string name="greenhouse_blurb">Determining the exact greenhouse effect is beyond the scope of this project. Since this 

program is designed to be used by middle grade students, it was decided to accept a simple 

number to represent overall greenhouse effect. We decided that we would call the Earth’s 

greenhouse effect 1. No greenhouse effect would equal 0. Working backwards using the values

for Venus yielded a greenhouse effect of around 200 for the planet. There is no theoretical upper

limit for the effect, but since Venus’s greenhouse effect is about 200 times as strong as Earth’s

using this formula, we decided to set an upper limit of 500.

We were able to come up with a value for greenhouse effect by starting with the formula: 

where �!" equals the greenhouse effect. Solving for �!" yields:

 Substituting known values for Earth yields: 

 So 0.584 become the greenhouse constant that is multiplied by the greenhouse effect
